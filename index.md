### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1 was one of my favorite labs because being a computer engineer major that was my first time actually coding. Looking back at Lab 1 now everything I learned then I can do now ithout evem thinking about it. I really enjoyed this but I didnt know how difficult the labs would ed up being.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7 was a lab that I really enjoyed because im a gambling addict. I really enjoy blackjack and the lab was very cool knowing I coded a program that calculated what value was in my hand. I wish I could use that in real life when I play blackjack.

* Lab 4

    I also enjoyed Lab 4 because it was my first time with a partner I did not know. Getting to know my parter and cooperate to do the lab was very fun and difficult at time because someetimes it felt like one person lknew way more than the other. But Lab 4 converting metric units was fery enjotayble also.
